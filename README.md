Today's challenge is to work as a team, divide the work, share a repo and get a working prototype up by the end of class.

### Today's Checklist

1. First build this project in the terminal
1. Then attach it to the DOM
1. Work through the challenge together
1. As always whiteboard it and make a code plan
1. Translate from English to pseudo code then to JavaScript
1. Write tests and test with `npm test main.js`
1. Convert the pseudo code to real JavaScript Code
1. Use `node main.js` to run the game
1. Once the terminal app works, build a GUI for your
1. Present to class

### Setup

1. From your project directory, run `npm i` to tell NPM to install all the
node modules we use in this class (see `package.json`)
1. Use your textEditor (VS Code) to change your files.
1. When you're finished `git status`, stage your file `git add .`, commit your changes `git commit -m "functions working"`, and push to
GitHub `git push`
    ```bash
    git status
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial Commit"
    git push origin gh-pages
    ```

1. Now go to your forked repository on GitHub (at
  https://github.com/your-username/javascript-workbook). A little yellow box
  should have popped up asking you to make a Pull Request. Click to review.

1. Click "Create Pull Request"

1. Every time you make a change *and push to GitHub*, this PR will automatically
update. No need to do it more than once.
